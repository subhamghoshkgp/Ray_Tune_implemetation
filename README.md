# Ray_Tune_implemetation
This repository contains a PyTorch-based implementation for face detection and localization using a VGG16 backbone. The code demonstrates how to set up a custom dataset, partition data, define a model for bounding box regression, and visualize results using bounding boxes on images. Example code is provided for Google Colab, including dataset loading from Google Drive.

# Features
1.Custom PyTorch Dataset for face detection with bounding box and label support  
2.Data partitioning into train, validation, and test sets  
3.Preprocessing and augmentation using torchvision transforms  
4.VGG16-based regression model for predicting face bounding boxes  
5.Training and evaluation loops with loss visualization  
6.Visualization utilities to display images with predicted bounding boxes
